# Retail_Data_Analysis
  In this project, our main objectives encompass several tasks. Initially, we will retrieve the sales data from the Kafka server. Subsequently, the data will undergo preprocessing to derive additional columns, such as total_cost, among others. Our next focus will be on calculating Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) based on time intervals and also considering the country factor.  These KPIs will be meticulously computed to gain insights into sales performance. Lastly, the results will be stored in separate JSON files, organized by 10-minute intervals, facilitating further in-depth analysis. Through this comprehensive approach, we aim to extract valuable insights and optimize decision-making processes.
